            <h1>My journey from God into the world of IT</h1>
            <h2>Finally 36 - and ready to start over. Again</h2>
            <p>It took me 36 years, a pandemic, and a series of questionable career moves - but here I am, with the rare opportunity to hit reset. And I have to say: being a German citizen comes with its perks. Free education? Yes, please.</p>
            <p>Right after high school, I went straight to university and studied theology - because I wanted to go deep. Real deep. I wasn't looking for an easy way out, I was looking for meaning. I wanted to understand what I believed in, why I believed it, and what it all meant. Life, faith, purpose - the big stuff. Back then, I was religious and genuinely hungry for answers. Life, faith, truth - the full package. Liberal arts? Sure. But this wasn't just liberal - it was existential.</p>
            <p>And because digging once apparently wasn't enough, I later started a Master's in Education, Dialogue & Religions. Only two module exams and a thesis stood between me and the fancy cap. But then came a key moment - the sort of existential micro-earthquake that makes you rethink everything. Let's just say: my faith in "official dialogue between religions" imploded faster than you can say "Amen." I didn't drop out that day - I simply stopped moving. Unconsciously, I tossed the programme onto my mental back seat and drove on for years, motivation flatlining. Much later, in a bout of self-reflection (thank you, systemic coaching tools), I finally saw the "good" reason: my inner compass had already decided that this path no longer made sense for me - "good" not in the moral sense, but in the there-is-always-a-valid-why sense. With the half-finished Master still hitch-hiking in my rear-view mirror, I worked in the social and educational field for years.</p>
            <p>I met people doing their jobs with real passion. Purpose. Drive. And then I saw others... just surviving in the beautiful chaos of capitalism; people burnt out, going through the motions, trapped in a system that cared more about profit than people. That wasn't for me.</p>
            <p>So I made a choice: I wanted a new direction. A different kind of purpose. Or at least, something which didn't feel so hypocrite. And thanks to Germany's system of paid further education, I could actually do that - in theory. In practice you're often at the mercy of the person who's sitting across the desk at the Arbeitsagentur.</p>
            <p>Spoiler: I didn't win the case-worker lottery. So there I was, post-pandemic, meeting my caseworker at the Arbeitsagentur - a woman so underwhelmingly motivated, she could've been replaced by an out-of-office reply. And voila - I ended up in a course that made no sense for me. None. Nada.<br>
            Wrong field, wrong direction - just... wrong.</p>
            <p>But hey, people say everything happens for a reason, right? Somewhere between "What am I doing here?" and "This coffee is terrible," I stumbled across something that did make sense: IT. Computers. Code. Logic. Creativity. Problem-solving. That clicked.</p>
            <p>So I asked for another education voucher - this time, for something IT-related. And guess what? Same caseworker. Same result. Bureaucracy: 1, Motivation: 0.</p>
            <p>Now, a full IT retraining would've been the logical next step - but financially? Not an option. I simply couldn't afford it. At the same time, I really wanted to arrive somewhere professionally. Not just do "a job" - I wanted to build something. Stability, purpose, a future. So I came up with a plan: sneak into the IT world through the back door.</p>
            <p>That's how I ended up in Payroll - within a software company. Honestly, the topic was surprisingly sexy - complex systems, serious responsibility. I had genuine enthusiasm and a roadmap... but it would have taken years.</p>
            <p>And reality? Not always a team player. The deadlines were relentless - the same cycle, month after month. I can handle pressure, but a permanently maxed-out stress level? That's a fast-track to burnout, and I still plan on enjoying life. The pressure was high, and the workplace... well, let's just say it wasn't exactly "Namaste at the office." Toxic vibes included.</p>
            <p>So here I am. Sitting in my home office, late at night, typing these words. Starting over. Again. At 36.</p>
            <p>This time, I know what I want. I know how I want to work. I know what I bring to the table - not just skills, but the full journey. Everything I've learned, lived, and wrestled with. That's my personal syntax. My reboot. Let's see where this line of code takes me.</p>
